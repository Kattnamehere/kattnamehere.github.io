                <h2>First Website</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my first website and my first big project! I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and insights with you all through this blog.
                    It's been a journey getting to this point, and I can't wait to see where it leads. I made this website in just over a week, which is pretty good considering I'm not the best designer.
                    This was all created using HTML, CSS, and JS only, no fancy dynamic web app libraries here! It's all hosted on GitHub, so if you're interested, you can browse through all of my commits
                    and see the progress from the beginning. If you're wondering about the font, it's called Mint Grotesk.</p>

                <h2>Blog</h2>
                <p>You might not see much from the git commits because I was mostly working on a local copy of the Git repository and not actively committing to another branch, but this blog page
                    has been in the works for a while now, right around when I added the "blog" button to the header.</p>

                <h2>Mobile Optimizations</h2>
                <p>I'm really proud to say that this website is fully optimized for mobile (at least well enough for most mobile devices). Here are some of the techniques I used:
                <ul>
                    <li>Media Queries: Adjusting the layout for different screen sizes.</li>
                    <li>Flexible Grids: Implementing CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptable layouts.</li>
                    <li>Viewport Meta Tag: Ensuring proper scaling on mobile devices.</li>
                </ul>
                    If you encounter any issues with the mobile experience, please let me know, and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible!</p>

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                <p>It's been really fun developing this. I've learned a lot, especially on the Git and CSS/HTML side of things.
                    I'll probably continue to add cool features that I have on my "checklist," but eventually, I might lose interest in this project. As for the blog,
                    if I'm passionate enough, I'll post some of my projects here. My next post will probably explain how I made this website and some tricky things I encountered along the way.
